# DAO

A Decentralised Autonomous Organisation built with React and Hardhat/Ethers.js.

```
cd /hardhat
npm i
npx hardhat node

```

## Project Aim

To understand the fundamentals of a DAO. Create contract calls that automatically update the DAO's state and UI. 

Identify common flaws in a DAO model, such as admin keys 🔑 and how whales can manipulate proposals simply through their wealth.
